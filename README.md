# YoutubeFullscreen
Tiny extension to force YouTube embeds to allow fullscreen.
Works by setting `allowfullscreen` on the iframe and reloads it.

# Install
## Chrome, Edge, Brave & Other Chromium based browsers
**NOTE FOR BRAVE:** Since unsigned extensions cannot be added, you must extract the ZIP file and load it as "Unpacked".
To install go to `chrome://extensions`, and enable developer mode. Download the CRX file from the releases, then drag it from your downloads to your browser. Click "add".
## Firefox
Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click "Load temporary addon", select the ZIP file from the releases. You will need to enable permissions for the addon to work.
